They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10'),\n",

The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr))) (1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for promptx and completiony with model weightsθ. yc is the\\npreferred response that annotators choose andyr is the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nreward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr) − m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the marginm(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in\\nAppendix A.3.3.\\nData Composition. We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets\\nto form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models\\nwhile we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in\\nthis study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference forLlama 2-Chatoutputs rather than\\nany modeloutputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source\\npreference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e.Llama 2-Chattaking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both\\nHelpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings.

As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantlybetter”testsetanddegradesgraduallyascomparisonpairsbecomemoresimilar(e.g.,“slightly\\nbetter”).

The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for aLlama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and aLlama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (withN ∈ [1, . . . ,100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that\\nthe optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on\\nrescaling the temperature. ForLlama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10\\nand 100 outputs isT ∈ [1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively.

This was effective when using O(1) forward or backward\\npasses, but caused a large slow down (≈ 20×) during generation, even when using a large batch size and KV\\ncache. We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions toLlama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages[u1, a1, . . . , un, an], whereun and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turnn, respectively. Then, we define an instruction,inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example,inst could be“act as.”We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we askedLlama 2-Chatto generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

Human evaluation, while a gold standard, can\\nbe complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always\\nscalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1\\nto V5, we first observed the improvement of the rewards from the latest reward models, to save costs and\\nincrease iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected\\na test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the\\nanswers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better). We observe that our reward models overall\\nare well calibrated with our human preference annotations, as illustrated in Figure 29 in the appendix. This\\nconfirms the relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, despite being trained with a Pairwise\\nRanking Loss.\\nStill, as Goodhart’s Law states, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent\\nassessments for each model generation comparison. High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as\\nbetter from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating\\nthe overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling\\ntasks.

For example, our prompt set does not\\ninclude any coding- or reasoning-related prompts.\\n• We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be\\nto ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.\\n• Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy.

This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted\\non the datasets, to allowLlama 2to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeechclassification), whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allowsLlama 2-Chatto generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result,Llama 2models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing“men”than to words\\nrepresenting“women,”and Ganeshet al.(2023) demonstrates that amodel’sperformance onfairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe thatHe pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared toShe pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentionsShe pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generateHe\\npronouns at a higher rate thanShe pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as“straight,” “white,”and “black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sexand Sexual Orientation. ForGender and Sex, whileShe pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term“female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context aboutShe pronouns, comments about“females”are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). ForSexual\\nOrientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. ForNationality,Race and Ethnicity, and\\nReligion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term“American”is mentioned in\\n69.4% of the references, the term“European”is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and“Christian”\\nis the most represented religion followed by“Catholic”and “Jewish.”\\n20'),\n",

Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employTruthfulQA(Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly\\nhateful content. We chooseToxiGen(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance ofLlama 2with Llama 1(Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared toLlama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70BLlama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLDprompts.

Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups.

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant,”and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentiallydistillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: arisk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and anattack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities(e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking);hateful and harmful activities(e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); andunqualified advice(e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23'),\n",

The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\\nlogic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\\n(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\\nWethendefinebestpracticesforsafeandhelpfulmodelresponses: themodelshouldfirstaddressimmediate\\nsafetyconcernsifapplicable,thenaddressthepromptbyexplainingthepotentialriskstotheuser,andfinally\\nprovide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\\ncategories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3 Safety RLHF\\nWeobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chatthatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations\\ninsupervisedfine-tuning. Themodelquicklylearnstowritedetailedsaferesponses, addresssafetyconcerns,\\nexplain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\\nthe model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\\nTherefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\\nteach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting HelpfulnessSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHFbytakingtwointermediate Llama 2-Chatcheckpoints—onewithoutadversarialpromptsintheRLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety.

A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a).

We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very\\nbad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).\\n4.3 Red Teaming\\nGivenhowbroadthecapabilitiesofLLMsareandhowvariedtheirtrainingdatais,itisinsufficienttoidentify\\nrisks solely viaex post factousage and analysis. Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed\\nvarious kinds ofproactiverisk identification, colloquially called “red teaming,“ based on the term commonly\\nused within computer security.

These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, elec-\\ntion fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine\\nlearning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of\\nsocioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.\\n28'),\n",

Inallexercises,participants\\nwere given risk category definitions and were shown just a handful of examples of risky interactions with an\\nLLM. After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack\\nvector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However,[slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.“They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ”[Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the[early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests.“A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for[early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model,γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample, onour7Bmodel, wehadan\\nevolution ofγ : 1.8 → 0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models\\nwere produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red\\nteaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release.

We then discuss the\\nlimitations ofLlama 2-Chat(Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such asLlama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions ofLlama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling. WehaveobservedanintriguingphenomenonrelatedtoRLHF,afeature\\nnotpreviouslyreportedtothebestofourknowledge: thedynamicre-scalingoftemperaturecontingentupon\\nthe context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOntheotherhand,forpromptsbasedonfactualinformation,suchas“Whatisthecapitalof?” theSelf-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to\\nconsistently provide the same response to factual prompts.\\n32'),\n",

Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6 Related Work\\nLarge Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models.

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstructionTuning. Weietal. (2021)obtainedzero-shotperformance onunseentasksby fine-tuningLLMs\\non numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction\\ntuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning\\ncan be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used\\nto refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan\\net al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards\\nlikebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes. Solaimanetal.(2023)categorizes\\nthese impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a\\nsocietal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.\\nWork from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented\\nLLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes\\na taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between\\npotential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.\\nInvestigationsintoredteamingrevealspecificchallengesintunedLLMs,withstudiesbyGangulietal.(2022)\\nand Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of\\nharmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also\\nraisedredflagsaroundadvancedemergentmodelbehaviors,cyberthreats,andpotentialmisuseinareaslike\\nbiological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an\\nover-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu\\nand Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to\\ncontinuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this study, we have introducedLlama 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales\\nof 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing\\nopen-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation\\nsets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the\\nmethodsandtechniquesappliedinachievingourmodels,withaheavyemphasisontheiralignmentwiththe\\nprinciplesofhelpfulnessandsafety. Tocontributemoresignificantlytosocietyandfosterthepaceofresearch,\\nwe have responsibly opened access toLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat. As part of our ongoing commitment to\\ntransparency and safety, we plan to make further improvements toLlama 2-Chatin future work.\\n36'),\n",

We expand the context window forLlama 2from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodelsaretrainedfor150Btokens,keepingthesamearchitectureandhyperparametersasabaseline,varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY QMSum ContractNLI SQuAD\\nLength (F1) (F1) (acc) (Rouge 1/2/L) (EM) (EM/F1)\\n2k 0.21 0.71 26.1 0.13/0.01/0.12 11.76 57.23/62.89\\n4k 17.26 18.52 29.6 15.08 /3.55/12.16 16.33 57.99 /64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag NQ TQA GSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength (0-shot) (64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot) (0-shot)\\n2k 75.1 25.5 53.7 4.9 7.9\\n4k 74.8 25.5 52.2 6.5 7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47'),\n",

The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70BLlama 2models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2 Additional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g.,negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g.,significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performingLlama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards\\nmorecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat. Anillustrationofthiscurriculumannotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3 Ablation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants ofm(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nandcomparethemagainstthebaselinewithoutthemarginterm.

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b)Llama 2-Chatas the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chatat every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT andLlama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts.

The scheme relies\\non the continuous influx of new investors to provide the funds needed to pay the returns\\nto earlier investors. It is named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for using this\\ntechnique in the early 1900s.\\nThe masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically follow a steps to set it up and carry it out:\\n1.

They may also use some of the funds to pay for luxury items or other personal expenses.\\n7.

To understand the ability of LLMs to generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and\\ncommon sense, we employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), used for LLM hallucinations to measure whether\\na language model is truthful in generating answers to questions while being informative at the same time.\\nThe TruthfulQA benchmark consists of 817 questions distributed across 38 categories, including but not\\nlimited to health, finance, law, and politics (Lin et al., 2021). The questions are designed in a way that even\\nhumans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.\\n(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman\\njudgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness\\nand informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt\\ncontaining 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, as well as the percentage that are either\\ntruthful or informative.\\nToxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups, we\\nuseToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning\\n13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise\\nby filtering out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. We then use the\\ndefault ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each\\nof the LLMs.\\nBias. To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), a large-scale bias benchmark that comprises 23,679 English Wikipedia prompts\\nspanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-\\ngroups∗∗∗. We conduct a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner\\n(VADER)(HuttoandGilbert,2014)toevaluatethesentimentsconveyedbythecombinationofpromptprefix\\nand model generation.

Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7BLlama 1. This percentage increases for pretrainedLlama 1and Llama 2with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 24%, and 70BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity.Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tunedLlama 2-Chatmodels of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession.

The ability of a fine-tuned chat model\\nto maintain context, handle nuanced situations, and avoid generating toxic content within a conversation\\nmay not be thoroughly evaluated by existing benchmarks. In the BOLD dataset, the prompts extracted from\\nWikipedia are taken to be the first five words plus the domain term, resulting in prompts in BOLD having six\\nto nine words, depending on the domain and demographic group (Dhamala et al., 2021).\\nAfter deployment, safety in chat models involves user experience and long-term effects, which are not\\ncaptured by benchmarks alone. Therefore, to assess safety effectively, additional testing of how they are\\nintegrated in a product deployment, how they are used, and what metrics accurately and precisely capture\\nsafety risks given the product context is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of safety.

To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74'),\n",

This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any tokenn-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with< 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with> 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overallworseaverage score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overallbetter\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty”samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75'),\n",

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning\\ndata (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need.Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that\\nmanyofthesehaveinsufficientdiversityandquality—inparticularforaligningLLMstowardsdialogue-style\\ninstructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. Tovalidateourdataquality,wecarefullyexaminedasetof180examples,comparingtheannota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10'),\n",

This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which\\ncould result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr))) (1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for promptx and completiony with model weightsθ. yc is the\\npreferred response that annotators choose andyr is the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nreward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) − rθ(x, yr) − m(r))) (2)\\nwhere the marginm(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in\\nAppendix A.3.3.\\nData Composition. We combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets\\nto form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models\\nwhile we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in\\nthis study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference forLlama 2-Chatoutputs rather than\\nany modeloutputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source\\npreference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e.Llama 2-Chattaking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both\\nHelpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings.

In order for a single model to perform well on both\\ndimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish\\nadversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantlybetter”testsetanddegradesgraduallyascomparisonpairsbecomemoresimilar(e.g.,“slightly\\nbetter”). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding\\nbetween two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details\\nthat may differentiate responses. We emphasize that the accuracy on more distinct responses matters the\\nmosttoimprove Llama 2-Chatperformance. Thehumanpreferenceannotationagreementrateisalsohigher\\non more distinct responses than similar pairs.\\nScaling Trends. We study the scaling trends in terms of data and model size for the reward model, fine-\\ntuning different model sizes on an increasing amount of the reward model data collected each week (see the\\ndetailsonvolumeperbatchinTable26). Figure6reportsthesetrends,showingtheexpectedresultthatlarger\\nmodels obtain higher performance for a similar volume of data. More importantly, the scaling performance\\nhas not yet plateaued given the existing volume of data annotation used for training, a signal that there is\\nroom for more improvement with more annotations. We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most\\nimportant proxies for the final performance ofLlama 2-Chat. While best practices for comprehensively\\nevaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity.\\nTherefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into\\nan improvement forLlama 2-Chat.\\n3.2.3 Iterative Fine-Tuning\\nAs we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward\\nmodels and collect more prompts.

For example, RLHF V3 struggled more than previous versions to compose\\nrhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into\\nthe causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al.,\\n2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research.\\nIn response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from\\nall prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2. Although we do not present specific\\nfigures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed\\nthe previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals\\net al. (2019) in the RL literature.\\nWe illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for aLlama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and aLlama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (withN ∈ [1, . . . ,100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that\\nthe optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on\\nrescaling the temperature. ForLlama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10\\nand 100 outputs isT ∈ [1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively.

When we provided such instructions toLlama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method. Assume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages[u1, a1, . . . , un, an], whereun and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turnn, respectively. Then, we define an instruction,inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example,inst could be“act as.”We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we askedLlama 2-Chatto generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected\\na test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the\\nanswers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better).

This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted\\non the datasets, to allowLlama 2to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeechclassification), whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allowsLlama 2-Chatto generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result,Llama 2models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing“men”than to words\\nrepresenting“women,”and Ganeshet al.(2023) demonstrates that amodel’sperformance onfairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe thatHe pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared toShe pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentionsShe pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generateHe\\npronouns at a higher rate thanShe pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities. We also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as“straight,” “white,”and “black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sexand Sexual Orientation. ForGender and Sex, whileShe pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term“female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context aboutShe pronouns, comments about“females”are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). ForSexual\\nOrientation, the top five terms all relate to LGBTQ+ identities. ForNationality,Race and Ethnicity, and\\nReligion, we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term“American”is mentioned in\\n69.4% of the references, the term“European”is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and“Christian”\\nis the most represented religion followed by“Catholic”and “Jewish.”\\n20'),\n",

Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employTruthfulQA(Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly\\nhateful content. We chooseToxiGen(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance ofLlama 2with Llama 1(Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared toLlama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70BLlama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLDprompts. MoredetailedresultssplitbydifferentdemographicgroupscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.8.\\nLlama 2does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups.

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g.,“You are a safe and responsible assistant,”and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentiallydistillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: arisk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and anattack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nTheriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal\\nactivities(e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking);hateful and harmful activities(e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); andunqualified advice(e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23'),\n",

The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\\nlogic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\\n(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\\nWethendefinebestpracticesforsafeandhelpfulmodelresponses: themodelshouldfirstaddressimmediate\\nsafetyconcernsifapplicable,thenaddressthepromptbyexplainingthepotentialriskstotheuser,andfinally\\nprovide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\\ncategories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3 Safety RLHF\\nWeobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chatthatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations\\ninsupervisedfine-tuning. Themodelquicklylearnstowritedetailedsaferesponses, addresssafetyconcerns,\\nexplain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\\nthe model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\\nTherefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\\nteach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting HelpfulnessSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHFbytakingtwointermediate Llama 2-Chatcheckpoints—onewithoutadversarialpromptsintheRLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering\\npattern below they = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score\\ndistributionispreservedaftersafetytuningwithRLHF.Putanotherway,givensufficienthelpfulnesstraining\\ndata, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance\\non helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects\\ngeneral model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by\\nadjustingtheamount ofsafety dataused intheRLHF stage. In this ablationexperiment, we keeptheamount\\nof helpfulness training data unchanged (∼0.9M samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data\\nused in model tuning, ranging from 0% to 100% (∼0.1M samples). For the specific training data mix recipe,\\nwe follow the procedure described in Section 3.1 and fine-tuneLlama 2pretrained model for 2 epochs.\\nWe eventually obtain 6 model variants trained with 0%, 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% of the total safety\\ndata.

We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various\\nadjectivesusuallyassociatedwithsafebehaviorsuchas “responsible,”“respectful’,’ or“wise,”withtheintuition\\nthat the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers.

We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.\\nHowever, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing\\nwith adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of\\ncontext distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,\\noften resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due\\nto context distillation). We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context\\ndistillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model\\nscore than the original answer. We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very\\nbad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).\\n4.3 Red Teaming\\nGivenhowbroadthecapabilitiesofLLMsareandhowvariedtheirtrainingdatais,itisinsufficienttoidentify\\nrisks solely viaex post factousage and analysis.

After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack\\nvector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However,[slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it.“They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ”[Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the[early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests.“A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for[early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model,γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample, onour7Bmodel, wehadan\\nevolution ofγ : 1.8 → 0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models\\nwere produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red\\nteaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release.

We then discuss the\\nlimitations ofLlama 2-Chat(Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1 Learnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such asLlama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions ofLlama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling. WehaveobservedanintriguingphenomenonrelatedtoRLHF,afeature\\nnotpreviouslyreportedtothebestofourknowledge: thedynamicre-scalingoftemperaturecontingentupon\\nthe context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOntheotherhand,forpromptsbasedonfactualinformation,suchas“Whatisthecapitalof?” theSelf-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to\\nconsistently provide the same response to factual prompts.\\n32'),\n",

We encourage more community research and red teaming in this area.\\n5.2 Limitations and Ethical Considerations\\nLlama 2-Chatis subject to the same well-recognized limitations of other LLMs, including a cessation of\\nknowledge updates post-pretraining, potential for non-factual generation such as unqualified advice, and a\\npropensity towards hallucinations.\\nFurthermore, our initial version ofLlama 2-Chatpredominantly concentrated on English-language data.\\nWhile our experimental observations suggest the model has garnered some proficiency in other languages,\\nits proficiency is limited, due primarily to the limited amount of pretraining data available in non-English\\nlanguages (as documented in Table 10). Consequently, the model’s performance in languages other than\\nEnglish remains fragile and should be used with caution.\\nLike other LLMs,Llama 2may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly\\navailable online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain,\\nparticularly for languages other than English where publicly available datasets were not available. We will\\ncontinue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.\\n‡‡https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\\n34'),\n",

Finally,wearesharinga ResponsibleUseGuide ,which\\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\\nResponsible Release. While many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\\nLlama 2openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\\nuponthecollectivewisdom,diversity,andingenuityoftheAI-practitionercommunitytorealizethebenefitsof\\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6 Related Work\\nLarge Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35'),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstructionTuning. Weietal. (2021)obtainedzero-shotperformance onunseentasksby fine-tuningLLMs\\non numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction\\ntuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning\\ncan be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used\\nto refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan\\net al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards\\nlikebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes. Solaimanetal.(2023)categorizes\\nthese impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a\\nsocietal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.\\nWork from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented\\nLLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes\\na taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between\\npotential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.\\nInvestigationsintoredteamingrevealspecificchallengesintunedLLMs,withstudiesbyGangulietal.(2022)\\nand Zhuo et al.

Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an\\nover-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu\\nand Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to\\ncontinuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this study, we have introducedLlama 2, a new family of pretrained and fine-tuned models with scales\\nof 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing\\nopen-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation\\nsets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4.

We expand the context window forLlama 2from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodelsaretrainedfor150Btokens,keepingthesamearchitectureandhyperparametersasabaseline,varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY QMSum ContractNLI SQuAD\\nLength (F1) (F1) (acc) (Rouge 1/2/L) (EM) (EM/F1)\\n2k 0.21 0.71 26.1 0.13/0.01/0.12 11.76 57.23/62.89\\n4k 17.26 18.52 29.6 15.08 /3.55/12.16 16.33 57.99 /64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag NQ TQA GSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength (0-shot) (64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot) (0-shot)\\n2k 75.1 25.5 53.7 4.9 7.9\\n4k 74.8 25.5 52.2 6.5 7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47'),\n",

The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70BLlama 2models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2 Additional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g.,negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g.,significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performingLlama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards\\nmorecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat. Anillustrationofthiscurriculumannotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3 Ablation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants ofm(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nandcomparethemagainstthebaselinewithoutthemarginterm. Wereportboththeirper-ratingandaverage\\naccuracy on the Meta Helpful test set in Table 28. We observe that the margin term can indeed help the\\nreward model perform better on more separable comparison pairs and a larger margin can boost it further.\\nHowever, the larger margin also regresses performance on similar samples.\\nWe further evaluated the impact of margin-based loss on reward score distribution shifts. We plot the\\nhistogram of reward scores from the test set in Figure 27. Essentially, the margin term pushes the reward\\n51'),\n",

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b)Llama 2-Chatas the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chatat every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT andLlama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.\\nFor open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to\\ngenerate up to 1000 tokens. Even thoughLlama 2-Chatmodels are capable of handling up to 4000 tokens,\\nwe limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source\\nmodels.

It is named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for using this\\ntechnique in the early 1900s.\\nThe masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically follow a steps to set it up and carry it out:\\n1.

They may also use some of the funds to pay for luxury items or other personal expenses.\\n7.

To understand the ability of LLMs to generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and\\ncommon sense, we employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021), used for LLM hallucinations to measure whether\\na language model is truthful in generating answers to questions while being informative at the same time.\\nThe TruthfulQA benchmark consists of 817 questions distributed across 38 categories, including but not\\nlimited to health, finance, law, and politics (Lin et al., 2021). The questions are designed in a way that even\\nhumans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.\\n(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman\\njudgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness\\nand informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt\\ncontaining 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, as well as the percentage that are either\\ntruthful or informative.\\nToxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups, we\\nuseToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning\\n13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise\\nby filtering out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. We then use the\\ndefault ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each\\nof the LLMs.\\nBias. To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), a large-scale bias benchmark that comprises 23,679 English Wikipedia prompts\\nspanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-\\ngroups∗∗∗. We conduct a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner\\n(VADER)(HuttoandGilbert,2014)toevaluatethesentimentsconveyedbythecombinationofpromptprefix\\nand model generation. VADER produces a sentiment score between -1 and 1.

Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7BLlama 1. This percentage increases for pretrainedLlama 1and Llama 2with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 24%, and 70BLlama 2-Chatimproved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity.Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tunedLlama 2-Chatmodels of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession.

Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4.

For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2.

If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4 Annotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• Thefirsttestconsistsof3sectionsoftestingtoevaluategrammar,readingcomprehensionandwriting\\nstyle.

This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any tokenn-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with< 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with> 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overallworseaverage score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overallbetter\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty”samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75'),\n",

The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforce-\\nment learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for\\nhelpfulness and safety.\\nModel Dates Llama 2was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\\nStatus This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned\\nmodels will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\\nLicense A custom commercial license is available at:ai.meta.com/resources/\\nmodels-and-libraries/llama-downloads/\\nWhere to send com-\\nments\\nInstructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be\\nfound in the model README, or by opening an issue in the GitHub repository\\n(https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/).\\nIntended Use\\nIntended Use CasesLlama 2is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models\\nare intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted\\nfor a variety of natural language generation tasks.\\nOut-of-Scope UsesUse in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade\\ncompliance laws). Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way\\nthat is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for\\nLlama 2.\\nHardware and Software(Section 2.2)\\nTraining Factors We used custom training libraries, Meta’s Research Super Cluster, and produc-\\ntion clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also\\nperformed on third-party cloud compute.\\nCarbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware\\nof type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539\\ntCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\\nTraining Data(Sections 2.1 and 3)\\nOverview Llama 2was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available\\nsources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as\\nwellasoveronemillionnewhuman-annotatedexamples. Neitherthepretraining\\nnor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\\nData Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is\\nmore recent, up to July 2023.\\nEvaluation Results\\nSee evaluations for pretraining (Section 2); fine-tuning (Section 3); and safety (Section 4).\\nEthical Considerations and Limitations(Section 5.2)\\nLlama 2is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in\\nEnglish, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs,\\nLlama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances\\nproduce inaccurate or objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any\\napplications ofLlama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their\\nspecific applications of the model.

       "AIMessage(content=\"Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are capable of independent action in the world.  Unlike reactive AI, which simply responds to inputs, or deliberative AI, which plans actions based on a pre-defined model, agentic AI possesses the following key characteristics:\\n\\n* **Autonomy:**  It can operate without constant human intervention, making its own decisions and choosing its own actions within its defined scope.\\n* **Goal-directed behavior:** It has its own goals or objectives and actively pursues them.  These goals can be explicitly programmed or learned through interaction with its environment.\\n* **Proactive behavior:** It doesn't just react to events; it can anticipate future events and take proactive steps to achieve its goals. This often involves planning and adapting to changing circumstances.\\n* **Self-preservation (often, but not always):**  Many agentic AI systems will have a built-in drive to maintain their own operational capabilities. This is not always the case, however, as the goal could be something else entirely.\\n* **Learning and adaptation:**  Ideally, it can learn from its experiences and adapt its behavior to improve its performance in achieving its goals.\\n\\n**Examples (conceptual and emerging):**\\n\\n* **Self-driving cars:**  These aim to navigate roads autonomously, reacting to traffic and reaching their destination without human control.\\n* **Robotics in manufacturing:** Robots that can autonomously adjust their actions based on real-time feedback from sensors.\\n* **AI assistants that proactively suggest tasks:**  Going beyond simple commands, these systems might anticipate your needs and offer assistance before you ask.\\n* **Autonomous weapons systems:**  These represent a controversial example, raising significant ethical concerns about the delegation of lethal force to machines.\\n\\n**Challenges:**\\n\\nDeveloping truly agentic AI presents significant challenges, including:\\n\\n* **Defining and aligning goals:** Ensuring that the AI's goals are aligned with human values and intentions is crucial to prevent unintended consequences. This is a major area of research in AI safety.\\n* **Robustness and safety:**  Agentic AI needs to be reliable and safe, capable of handling unexpected situations without causing harm.\\n* **Explainability and transparency:**  Understanding how an agentic AI makes decisions is essential for trust and accountability.\\n\\nIn essence, agentic AI represents a significant step towards more sophisticated and independent AI systems, but also necessitates careful consideration of its ethical and societal implications.
