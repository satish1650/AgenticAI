       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the difference between AI agents and Agentic AI. Let me start by recalling what I know about AI agents first. From what I remember, AI agents are basically programs designed to perform tasks autonomously. They can sense their environment and take actions to achieve some goal. They might use machine learning, but not necessarily. Like, a chatbot that helps with customer service is an AI agent because it interacts with users and tries to help based on its programming.\\n\\nNow, Agentic AI... Hmm, that term sounds less familiar. Maybe it\\'s a specific type or a new concept? Wait, I think I\\'ve heard it in the context of more advanced or self-aware systems. Maybe Agentic AI refers to AI that can act more independently or has some level of self-awareness? Or perhaps it\\'s part of a framework or a specific company\\'s terminology? I should check if there\\'s a standard definition for Agentic AI.\\n\\nLet me think of examples. If an AI agent is something like Siri or Alexa, then Agentic AI might be something more complex. Maybe it\\'s about AI that can work in teams or has social capabilities? Or perhaps it\\'s about AI that can modify its own code or learning processes, making it more autonomous. I\\'ve heard terms like \"autonomous AI\" or \"self-improving AI,\" which might be related.\\n\\nWait, there\\'s also the concept of \"agent-based systems\" where multiple agents interact. Could Agentic AI be referring to systems where multiple agents collaborate, making the whole more than the sum of parts? Or maybe it\\'s a specific project or product name. Maybe I should consider if Agentic AI is a proprietary term used by a particular company or research group. For instance, sometimes companies like OpenAI or Google have their own terms for their technologies. \\n\\nAnother angle: \"agentic\" as an adjective might mean having the capacity to act on one\\'s own. So Agentic AI would emphasize the capability of the AI to act independently, make decisions, and perhaps even plan over time. So maybe the difference is that Agentic AI is a subset of AI agents that have higher levels of autonomy, decision-making, and maybe even self-awareness or self-modification.\\n\\nWait, but I should be careful not to confuse with terms like \"autonomous systems\" or \"general AI.\" Maybe Agentic AI is more about the design pattern where the AI operates as an agent with specific agency. Let me see if I can find any references or definitions.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific framework or concept. Let me try to break down the terms. \"AI agents\" is a broad category, while \"Agentic AI\" might be a more specific concept. Maybe Agentic AI refers to a particular approach where the AI has a certain level of self-direction, awareness of its goals, and the ability to adapt its strategies without human intervention. That could make it different from traditional AI agents which might be more task-specific and have fixed behaviors unless reprogrammed.\\n\\nAnother thought: in some contexts, Agentic AI might be part of a multi-agent system where each agent has its own goals and can interact with others, leading to emergent behaviors. In that case, Agentic AI would be part of a larger system where individual agents work together, each with their own agency. But that\\'s similar to agent-based models in computer science, which are used in simulations.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a newer term coined in recent discussions about advanced AI capabilities, such as those that can form intentions or have a sense of agency. For example, systems that can learn and adapt their objectives over time, or have some form of internal motivation beyond their initial programming.\\n\\nWait, also, there\\'s something called \"autonomous AI agents\" which are designed to operate without human intervention. So maybe Agentic AI is another term for that. Or perhaps it\\'s a marketing term used by a company to describe their AI\\'s capabilities.\\n\\nAlternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe the user is referring to \"Agentic AI\" as a specific project or technology. A quick search in my mind—since I can\\'t actually browse the internet—reminds me that sometimes \"Agentic AI\" isn\\'t a standard term, so the user might be conflating it with other concepts. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s a term from a specific paper or a recent development.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps the key difference is that AI agents are the broader category, while Agentic AI is a more advanced subset that emphasizes self-directedness, adaptability, and possibly even social interaction or collaboration with other agents. So, while all Agentic AI would be AI agents, not all AI agents are Agentic. It\\'s about the level of autonomy and the nature of their agency.\\n\\nWait, but I should also consider if there\\'s a distinction in technical terms. For instance, in reinforcement learning, agents learn through interaction, but that\\'s still within the AI agent framework. Maybe Agentic AI refers to agents that can set their own goals or have a more complex decision-making process. Or perhaps it\\'s about the AI\\'s ability to act as an independent entity in a system, like in decentralized systems.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"Agentic AI\" is a term used in certain academic circles to describe AI systems that exhibit goal-directed behavior and can plan and act to achieve those goals, which would actually be similar to standard AI agents. Hmm, maybe there\\'s confusion here. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific framework like Agentic AI being a particular implementation or architecture, such as using neural networks in a certain way. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Agentic AI\" is being used in the context of the recent \"AGI\" (Artificial General Intelligence) discussions, where AGI refers to systems with general intelligence. But then the spelling is different—Agentic vs. AGI. Maybe it\\'s a typo, but the user specified \"AgenticAI\" so probably not.\\n\\nWait, maybe \"Agentic AI\" refers to AI that operates with agency, meaning it has the capacity to act independently to achieve goals, which is similar to AI agents. But then why the different term? Maybe it\\'s emphasizing the concept of agency more strongly, perhaps in a way that differentiates from traditional rule-based agents. For example, if an AI can not only follow rules but also adapt and make decisions in unforeseen situations, that\\'s Agentic AI. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used in a specific paper or a book. For example, if I recall, in philosophy of AI, agency refers to the capacity to act intentionally. So Agentic AI would be AI systems with a stronger sense of agency, perhaps with the ability to set subgoals, plan over time, and adapt their strategies in complex environments. In that case, the difference is that AI agents are general, while Agentic AI is a more advanced form with higher agency.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a specific company\\'s product. Let me think—maybe there\\'s a company named Agentic AI? I\\'m not sure, but assuming that the user is asking about the general concept, perhaps the key distinction is the level of autonomy and the scope of their operation.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"Agentic AI\" is a mishearing or misspelling of \"agent-based AI,\" which would refer to AI systems composed of multiple agents. But even then, agent-based systems are a type of AI framework.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the term comes from the field of AI ethics, where \"agentic\" implies that the AI has moral agency or accountability, but that\\'s more of an ethical distinction.\\n\\nAlternatively, I might need to structure the answer by explaining that AI agents are a broad category, and Agentic AI is a more specific type, perhaps emphasizing certain features like autonomy, adaptability, or collaborative decision-making. Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used to describe AI that can act as independent entities in a system, coordinating with others, which would fall under multi-agent systems.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of \"Agentic\" as a noun form, like Agentic AI being AI that possesses agency, so it\\'s a subset of AI agents. So the difference would be that all Agentic AI are AI agents, but not all AI agents are Agentic unless they meet certain criteria for agency.\\n\\nWait, but I need to be precise. Since I can\\'t look it up, I have to go with what I know. Let me try to structure the answer step by step:\\n\\n1. Define AI agents: Any artificial intelligence that can perceive its environment and act to achieve goals. They can be rule-based, learning-based, etc.\\n\\n2. Define Agentic AI: If it\\'s a subset, perhaps emphasizing higher-level agency, like self-directedness, adaptability, maybe even social or collaborative behaviors.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a specific architecture where agents are designed to function in a decentralized, autonomous way, perhaps in a network or swarm intelligence setup.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the term is used in a particular context where \"Agentic\" refers to the ability to act as an independent agent with some form of consciousness or self-awareness, which would be more advanced.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to Agentic AI as a term used to describe AI systems that can operate in an agentic way, meaning they can make decisions and take actions as an agent would, perhaps more akin to human agency.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, the main difference might be that Agentic AI is a more advanced form of AI agent with enhanced autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities, possibly in complex, dynamic environments where traditional AI agents might follow predefined rules or models.\\n\\nAlternatively, Agentic AI might be a term used to describe AI systems that can act in an agentic manner, meaning they can set their own objectives, adapt their strategies, and perhaps even learn from interactions in a more self-driven way.\\n\\nAnother angle: In some contexts, \"agency\" in AI refers to the ability to act, so Agentic AI just emphasizes that aspect. But since the user is asking for the difference, I need to highlight that Agentic AI could be a more advanced or specific type of AI agent with enhanced agency features.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI refers to systems where the AI is designed to have more human-like agency, such as forming intentions, planning, and executing complex tasks in unstructured environments. \\n\\nIn summary, without a specific established definition for \"Agentic AI,\" the safest approach is to present AI agents as the general category and describe Agentic AI as a more advanced or specialized type within that category, possibly emphasizing autonomy, adaptability, or self-directedness. Alternatively, note that Agentic AI might not be a standard term and could be a specific term used in a particular context, requiring clarification. But since the user is asking for the difference, I\\'ll have to make an educated guess based on common terminology.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"AgenticAI\" is a company or a specific project. For instance, if I recall correctly, there is a company called Agentic AI, but I\\'m not sure. If that\\'s the case, then AgenticAI would be a specific implementation or platform for AI agents, but the user might be asking for the conceptual difference rather than a company comparison.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to \"Agentic\" as in \"agent-centric\" AI, focusing on the agent\\'s perspective, but that\\'s speculative.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used in some recent literature to describe AI systems that have a form of agency, like the ability to act purposefully, making decisions based on their goals, which is actually a basic feature of AI agents. So maybe the term is redundant, or emphasizes a particular aspect.\\n\\nHmm, this is a bit tricky since the exact definition might not be standard. To proceed, I\\'ll structure the answer by first explaining AI agents, then discussing possible interpretations of Agentic AI as a more advanced or specific form of AI agents, possibly with examples like autonomous decision-making, self-improvement, or multi-agent collaboration. Alternatively, if Agentic AI is a specific term from a paper or company, I can mention that the term might be context-dependent.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe distinction between **AI Agents** and **Agentic AI** can vary depending on context, but here\\'s a structured breakdown based on common usage and conceptual understanding:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. AI Agents**\\n- **Definition**: AI agents are systems designed to perceive their environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They operate based on predefined rules, algorithms, or learning models (e.g., machine learning, reinforcement learning).\\n- **Key Characteristics**:\\n  - **Autonomy**: Can act independently within defined parameters.\\n  - **Goal-oriented**: Directed by objectives set by developers (e.g., maximizing user engagement, solving a problem).\\n  - **Variety**: Includes chatbots, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.\\n  - **Scope**: Typically task-specific or domain-specific, though some can adapt through learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Agentic AI**\\nThis term is less commonly used in standard literature and may refer to either:\\n#### **a. A Subset of Advanced AI Agents**\\n- **Definition**: Refers to AI systems that exhibit heightened **agency**, emphasizing **self-direction, adaptability, and decision-making autonomy** beyond traditional AI agents.\\n- **Key Characteristics**:\\n  - **Self-Driven Goals**: Might set or modify their own objectives (e.g., an AI that evolves its goals based on environmental feedback).\\n  - **Dynamic Adaptation**: Can adjust strategies in novel situations without explicit reprogramming (e.g., an AI that \"learns on the job\").\\n  - **Social/Environmental Interaction**: Operates in collaborative or competitive environments with other agents (e.g., multi-agent systems in decentralized networks).\\n  - **Complex Decision-Making**: Uses advanced techniques like reinforcement learning, generative models, or meta-learning to handle uncertainty.\\n\\n#### **b. A Specific Framework/Technology**\\n  - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Sometimes called \"agentic\" when agents act collectively (e.g., swarm intelligence or decentralized networks like blockchain-based AI).\\n  - **Ethical/Moral Agency**: In academic discussions, \"agency\" might imply systems capable of ethical reasoning or accountability, though this is still theoretical.\\n\\n#### **c. Proprietary/Company-Specific Terminology**\\n  - Could refer to a brand name (e.g., a company named \"Agentic AI\") or a proprietary technology emphasizing autonomous, adaptive AI. For example, an AI platform designed for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Differences**\\n| **Aspect**                | **AI Agents**                                  | **Agentic AI**                                |\\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\\n| **Scope**                  | Broad category (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems). | Subset emphasizing **enhanced agency**: self-direction, adaptability, or emergent behavior. |\\n| **Autonomy**               | Operates within predefined rules or models.   | May autonomously redefine goals, adapt strategies, or collaborate with other agents. |\\n| **Learning/Adaptation**    | Can learn (e.g., through ML), but usually within fixed parameters. | Might learn and evolve dynamically, possibly through self-improvement or social interaction. |\\n| **Complexity**             | Ranges from simple (rule-based) to complex (deep learning-driven). | Typically involves advanced techniques like self-supervised learning, multi-agent coordination, or open-ended learning. |\\n| **Use Cases**              | Customer service, data analysis, gaming.       | Complex environments (e.g., robotics, decentralized systems, or real-time problem-solving). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **When the Terms Overlap**\\n- Agentic AI could be seen as a **subset of AI agents** that exemplify heightened agency, such as:\\n  - **Autonomous systems** (e.g., self-driving cars adjusting to unexpected scenarios).\\n  - **Swarm robotics** where robots collaborate as independent agents.\\n  - **Ethical AI frameworks** requiring accountability for decisions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Possible Confusions**\\n- **Agentic AI ≠ AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: AGI refers to human-like general intelligence, while Agentic AI focuses on agency rather than general capability.\\n- **Terminology Nuance**: \"Agentic\" might emphasize **agency** (the capacity to act purposefully) as a defining feature, making it a way to contrast highly autonomous agents with basic ones.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n- **AI Agents** are the broader category of systems that act to achieve goals.\\n- **Agentic AI** is a more specific term, likely emphasizing **autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making sophistication**—often in dynamic or multi-agent environments. If used as a proprietary term, it might denote a cutting-edge implementation of these principles.\\n\\nIf you encountered this term in a specific context (e.g., a paper, company, or framework), clarifying that context might be necessary for a precise definition.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3493, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 3513, 'completion_time': 8.576005421, 'prompt_time': 0.003183108, 'queue_time': 0.241723775, 'total_time': 8.579188529}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_512a3da6bb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--83210a41-25c1-46da-8150-433246368878-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 3493, 'total_tokens': 3513})"

      "Wait, but I should be careful not to confuse with terms like \"autonomous systems\" or \"general AI.\" Maybe Agentic AI is more about the design pattern where the AI operates as an agent with specific agency. Let me see if I can find any references or definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific framework or concept. Let me try to break down the terms. \"AI agents\" is a broad category, while \"Agentic AI\" might be a more specific concept. Maybe Agentic AI refers to a particular approach where the AI has a certain level of self-direction, awareness of its goals, and the ability to adapt its strategies without human intervention. That could make it different from traditional AI agents which might be more task-specific and have fixed behaviors unless reprogrammed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: in some contexts, Agentic AI might be part of a multi-agent system where each agent has its own goals and can interact with others, leading to emergent behaviors. In that case, Agentic AI would be part of a larger system where individual agents work together, each with their own agency. But that's similar to agent-based models in computer science, which are used in simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a newer term coined in recent discussions about advanced AI capabilities, such as those that can form intentions or have a sense of agency. For example, systems that can learn and adapt their objectives over time, or have some form of internal motivation beyond their initial programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, also, there's something called \"autonomous AI agents\" which are designed to operate without human intervention. So maybe Agentic AI is another term for that. Or perhaps it's a marketing term used by a company to describe their AI's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe the user is referring to \"Agentic AI\" as a specific project or technology. A quick search in my mind—since I can't actually browse the internet—reminds me that sometimes \"Agentic AI\" isn't a standard term, so the user might be conflating it with other concepts. Alternatively, maybe it's a term from a specific paper or a recent development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, perhaps the key difference is that AI agents are the broader category, while Agentic AI is a more advanced subset that emphasizes self-directedness, adaptability, and possibly even social interaction or collaboration with other agents. So, while all Agentic AI would be AI agents, not all AI agents are Agentic. It's about the level of autonomy and the nature of their agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I should also consider if there's a distinction in technical terms. For instance, in reinforcement learning, agents learn through interaction, but that's still within the AI agent framework. Maybe Agentic AI refers to agents that can set their own goals or have a more complex decision-making process. Or perhaps it's about the AI's ability to act as an independent entity in a system, like in decentralized systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe \"Agentic AI\" is a term used in certain academic circles to describe AI systems that exhibit goal-directed behavior and can plan and act to achieve those goals, which would actually be similar to standard AI agents. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific framework like Agentic AI being a particular implementation or architecture, such as using neural networks in a certain way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the term \"Agentic AI\" is being used in the context of the recent \"AGI\" (Artificial General Intelligence) discussions, where AGI refers to systems with general intelligence. But then the spelling is different—Agentic vs. AGI. Maybe it's a typo, but the user specified \"AgenticAI\" so probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe \"Agentic AI\" refers to AI that operates with agency, meaning it has the capacity to act independently to achieve goals, which is similar to AI agents. But then why the different term? Maybe it's emphasizing the concept of agency more strongly, perhaps in a way that differentiates from traditional rule-based agents. For example, if an AI can not only follow rules but also adapt and make decisions in unforeseen situations, that's Agentic AI. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used in a specific paper or a book. For example, if I recall, in philosophy of AI, agency refers to the capacity to act intentionally. So Agentic AI would be AI systems with a stronger sense of agency, perhaps with the ability to set subgoals, plan over time, and adapt their strategies in complex environments. In that case, the difference is that AI agents are general, while Agentic AI is a more advanced form with higher agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a specific company's product. Let me think—maybe there's a company named Agentic AI? I'm not sure, but assuming that the user is asking about the general concept, perhaps the key distinction is the level of autonomy and the scope of their operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe \"Agentic AI\" is a mishearing or misspelling of \"agent-based AI,\" which would refer to AI systems composed of multiple agents. But even then, agent-based systems are a type of AI framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the term comes from the field of AI ethics, where \"agentic\" implies that the AI has moral agency or accountability, but that's more of an ethical distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I might need to structure the answer by explaining that AI agents are a broad category, and Agentic AI is a more specific type, perhaps emphasizing certain features like autonomy, adaptability, or collaborative decision-making. Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used to describe AI that can act as independent entities in a system, coordinating with others, which would fall under multi-agent systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of \"Agentic\" as a noun form, like Agentic AI being AI that possesses agency, so it's a subset of AI agents. So the difference would be that all Agentic AI are AI agents, but not all AI agents are Agentic unless they meet certain criteria for agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I need to be precise. Since I can't look it up, I have to go with what I know. Let me try to structure the answer step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define AI agents: Any artificial intelligence that can perceive its environment and act to achieve goals. They can be rule-based, learning-based, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Define Agentic AI: If it's a subset, perhaps emphasizing higher-level agency, like self-directedness, adaptability, maybe even social or collaborative behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a specific architecture where agents are designed to function in a decentralized, autonomous way, perhaps in a network or swarm intelligence setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the term is used in a particular context where \"Agentic\" refers to the ability to act as an independent agent with some form of consciousness or self-awareness, which would be more advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to Agentic AI as a term used to describe AI systems that can operate in an agentic way, meaning they can make decisions and take actions as an agent would, perhaps more akin to human agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum up, the main difference might be that Agentic AI is a more advanced form of AI agent with enhanced autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities, possibly in complex, dynamic environments where traditional AI agents might follow predefined rules or models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, Agentic AI might be a term used to describe AI systems that can act in an agentic manner, meaning they can set their own objectives, adapt their strategies, and perhaps even learn from interactions in a more self-driven way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: In some contexts, \"agency\" in AI refers to the ability to act, so Agentic AI just emphasizes that aspect. But since the user is asking for the difference, I need to highlight that Agentic AI could be a more advanced or specific type of AI agent with enhanced agency features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI refers to systems where the AI is designed to have more human-like agency, such as forming intentions, planning, and executing complex tasks in unstructured environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, without a specific established definition for \"Agentic AI,\" the safest approach is to present AI agents as the general category and describe Agentic AI as a more advanced or specialized type within that category, possibly emphasizing autonomy, adaptability, or self-directedness. Alternatively, note that Agentic AI might not be a standard term and could be a specific term used in a particular context, requiring clarification. But since the user is asking for the difference, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe \"AgenticAI\" is a company or a specific project. For instance, if I recall correctly, there is a company called Agentic AI, but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then AgenticAI would be a specific implementation or platform for AI agents, but the user might be asking for the conceptual difference rather than a company comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to \"Agentic\" as in \"agent-centric\" AI, focusing on the agent's perspective, but that's speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe Agentic AI is a term used in some recent literature to describe AI systems that have a form of agency, like the ability to act purposefully, making decisions based on their goals, which is actually a basic feature of AI agents. So maybe the term is redundant, or emphasizes a particular aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, this is a bit tricky since the exact definition might not be standard. To proceed, I'll structure the answer by first explaining AI agents, then discussing possible interpretations of Agentic AI as a more advanced or specific form of AI agents, possibly with examples like autonomous decision-making, self-improvement, or multi-agent collaboration. Alternatively, if Agentic AI is a specific term from a paper or company, I can mention that the term might be context-dependent.\n",
